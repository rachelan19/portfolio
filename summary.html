    I chose to make a website based off my favorite pizza place, a place I used to go to all the time growing up and still go to every time I visit my hometown. I think it is clear to see they need a new website (a lot of text does not line up, links and nav bar ddoes not work, not a consistent design across pages, outdated graphics and no images, etc) so thought it would be cool to design one for my final since I did not have anything else I particularly wanted to do, and also thought it would be cool if they had an order ahead form in addition to having people calling the orders in. I tried to incorporate more colors and visuals in the website as well as organization. <p>My intended audience was people looking to find more information about Ciceros pizza, or people looking to order online, look at the menu and prices before they come, or see a few pictures and reviews.<p>For the extras, I used an order form that submits to its own confirmation page, and then used responsive web design on the home page to make pictures their own column on tablet, and then reviews and pictures separate columns on mobile.
