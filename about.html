    <h2>History</h2>
        <p>At Cicero's Pizza, we make a great product for a great value. Our thin crispy crust combined with other fresh ingredients makes our pizza unique and a local favorite.</p>
   
        <p>Established in 1968, the recipe for Cicero's Pizza originated in Niagara Falls, NY. Nunzio Cicero purchased the business that became Cicero's Pizza and made a significant mark on the culinary map. In 1974, Nunzio's son-in-law Bob LaVerdi joined the family business, followed by Nunzio's wife's grandson, Rik Jones, in 1978.</p>
        <p>Cicero's Pizza has witnessed the transformation of Santa Clara Valley from its agricultural roots to the tech-dominated Silicon Valley. Originally situated at the corner of Stevens Creek and DeAnza Boulevard, near the Cali Brothers Feed Mill, Cicero's was a central part of Old Cupertino's community life.</p>
        <p>Following redevelopment in the area, Cicero's Pizza relocated to the corner of Blaney Avenue. Then, in June 2001, Nunzio, at the venerable age of 87, retired and closed his beloved pizzeria. His legacy did not end there, as he passed away shortly after, leaving a rich heritage that his family would continue.</p>
        <p>In June 2002, Rik Jones and Bob LaVerdi, along with the support of Nunzio's grandchildren, reignited the Cicero's Pizza name at a new location in West San Jose, on the fringe of Cupertino. This move marked a new chapter for Cicero's Pizza, retaining its long-held traditions while embracing the evolving community around it.</p>
